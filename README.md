Ranks poker cards

This program allows the user to input two Poker hands, and compares the scores of the input hands to determine a winner. To begin the program, simply run from the Poker class and when prompted, input the hands as initials of rank and suit (the Ace of Hearts is AH, for example) separated by only a space (3D 4H 6C TD AH for example).
